Oklo's approach to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) centers on building, owning, and operating their own liquid-metal-cooled, fast reactors (using sodium as a coolant) which can use spent nuclear fuel as a fuel source.

This differs from many competitors and allows Oklo to target diverse customers, including data centers, with a build-own-operate model that focuses on a high-temperature, atmospheric pressure operation for greater scalability and efficiency.

Key Aspects of Oklo's Approach

    Liquid-Metal Fast Reactors (LMFRs):
    Unlike traditional light-water reactors that primarily use water as a coolant, Oklo's SMRs employ liquid metal (like sodium). This allows for higher operating temperatures at atmospheric pressure, increasing efficiency and reducing complexity.




Inherent Safety:
Oklo emphasizes the inherent safety features of its fast reactor technology, noting that its designs are self-stabilizing, self-controlling, and can operate safely using natural forces for cooling, according to Oklo Inc..

Scalability:
The reactors are offered in a phased approach, with designs ranging from 15MW to 75MW, allowing for flexibility and phased deployment.
