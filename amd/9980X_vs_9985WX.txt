AMD Ryzen Threadripper 9980X (a high-end desktop CPU) and the AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 9985WX (its workstation-oriented counterpart), based on recent releases in 2025.

Both are part of AMD's Zen 5-based Threadripper 9000 series, featuring 64 cores and designed for extreme multitasking, content creation, and compute-heavy workloads.

The main distinctions lie in memory support, target audience, pricing, and slight performance edges for the PRO model in multi-threaded scenarios.

The non-PRO 9980X offers better value for general users, while the PRO 9985WX is optimized for professional environments with enhanced memory capabilities and server-grade features.

Benchmarks show the two CPUs are very close, with the PRO model holding a slight edge (around 5-8% faster in multi-threaded tests), likely due to better binning for sustained workloads. Single-thread performance is nearly identical.

Single-Thread Rating**: 4,499 (9980X) vs. 4,511 (9985WX) — essentially tied.

Multi-Thread Rating (CPU Mark)**: 145,694 (9980X) vs. 153,774 (9985WX) — the 9985WX is about 5% faster.

Another dataset reports 153,564 (9980X) vs. 156,305 (9985WX).

In real-world scenarios:

Both excel in multi-core tasks like video rendering, 3D modeling, and simulations.

The 9985WX's 8 memory channels provide higher bandwidth (up to 380 GB/s vs. lower on the 9980X), making it better for memory-intensive applications like large datasets or virtualization.

Reviews note the 9980X as a strong gaming/creator option with high clocks, while the PRO is ideal for engineering or servers due to its expanded memory and stability features.

The 9980X scores higher (118% better per some metrics) due to its lower price and similar performance for most users.

CPU value ratings are 29.1 (9980X) vs. 19.2 (9985WX).

Choose the 9980X if you're building a high-end desktop for gaming, content creation, or general productivity.

9980X offers excellent performance without the premium cost.

Opt for the **9985WX** if you need workstation-grade features like massive RAM support (up to 2TB), more PCIe lanes for expansions, or enterprise reliability for tasks like AI training or scientific computing.

Both require robust cooling and a compatible motherboard; power consumption is high, so factor in electricity costs (~$64/year at full load).
