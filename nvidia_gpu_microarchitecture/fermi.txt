Fermi is the codename for a graphics processing unit (GPU) microarchitecture developed by Nvidia, first released to retail in April 2010, as the successor to the Tesla microarchitecture.

It was the primary microarchitecture used in the GeForce 400 series and 500 series.

All desktop Fermi GPUs were manufactured in 40nm, mobile Fermi GPUs in 40nm and 28nm[citation needed].

Fermi is the oldest microarchitecture from Nvidia that receives support for Microsoft's rendering API Direct3D 12 feature_level 11.
