Nvidia Tesla is the former name for a line of products developed by Nvidia targeted at stream processing or general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPU), named after pioneering electrical engineer Nikola Tesla.

Its products began using GPUs from the G80 series, and have continued to accompany the release of new chips.

They are programmable using the CUDA or OpenCL APIs.

The Nvidia Tesla product line competed with AMD's Radeon Instinct and Intel Xeon Phi lines of deep learning and GPU cards.

Nvidia retired the Tesla brand in May 2020, reportedly because of potential confusion with the brand of cars.

Its new GPUs are branded Nvidia Data Center GPUs[2] as in the Ampere-based A100 GPU.

Nvidia DGX servers feature Nvidia GPGPUs.
