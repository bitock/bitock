### Applications and Real-World Impact
D-Wave targets optimization-heavy domains where quantum annealing delivers measurable ROI today. A 2025 Wakefield Research study found business leaders expect significant returns from quantum optimization.

- **Industries**: Logistics, manufacturing, finance, telecommunications, public safety, and materials science.
- **Examples**:
  - **NTT Docomo (Telecom)**: Reduced network congestion paging signals by 15% during peaks using hybrid-quantum optimization of base station tracking areas, improving bandwidth and customer satisfaction.
  - **North Wales Police (Public Safety)**: Halved emergency response times by optimizing vehicle placementâ€”cutting planning from 4 months to 4 minutes via hybrid solvers.
  - **General Use Cases**: Workforce scheduling, vehicle routing, drug discovery, portfolio optimization, and AI enhancements (e.g., faster training with lower energy use).

Customers like Lockheed Martin, NASA, and Google have used D-Wave systems for years, with recent pilots showing 10-50% efficiency gains.
